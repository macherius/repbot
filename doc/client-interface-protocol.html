    <h1>RepBot client interface protocol (R-CLIP), version 0.1</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
      <a href="http://repbot.sourceforge.net">RepBot</a> is a non-playing 
      bot on <a href="fibs.com">fibs</a>, the First
      Internet Backgammon Server. RepBot provides a service to the fibs 
      user community allowing them to query the "Reputation" of a prospective
      opponent, and to influence that reputation by complaining against or
      vouching for a user. This helps players to avoid droppers or otherwise
      abusive players.
    </p>    

    <p>
      RepBot communicates with users using the fibs <code>tell</code> command.
      Usually this happens using a chat window within the graphical client
      interface. A number of client interface programs, however, integrate
      RepBot functionality natively. This document describes an interface
      provided specifically for these programs.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Note that RepBot is independent of the fibs server and is not endorsed
      by its administrators.
    </p>

    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    
    <p>
      The reasons for providing a distinct interface for client interface 
      programs are:
      <ul>
        <li>
	  Stability - the human-oriented protocol of the original RepBot 
	  command set changes for usability concerns or as new features
	  are added. This breaks client programs that expect the older format.
	  For example, the list command once generated a single repsonse
	  line per query. As users accumulated vouches (and complaints), it
	  became necessary to split the response into multiple lines.
	</li>

	<li>
	  Performance - client interface programs are likely to generate
	  a much higher volume of queries (for example, to show the user
	  the reputations of all logged-in users). The human-oriented protocol
	  does not provide for this.
	</li>

	<li>
	  Convenience - the human-oriented protocol is, well, human oriented.
	  As such it is loaded with punctuation and has some variations. It
	  is also slightly ambiguous.
	</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The client interface protocol addresses these issues in the following 
      ways:
      <ul>
        <li>
	  A stable, versioned protocol is provided. Once defined, a command's
	  query and response formats are guaranteed to be stable. When new
	  features are added, a new version of the command is added. Both the
	  old and new versions will continue to be supported.
	</li>
	
	<li>
	  Support is provided for multiple user queries so that the client 
	  interface can populate a user table quickly and efficiently.
	</li>

	<li>
	  The protocol is easily parseable; consisting of a sequence of
	  space-separated words and numbers.
	</li>
      </ul>	
    </p>

    <h2>Protocol specification</h2>

    <h3>General request/reply syntax</h3>

    <p>
      A client interface request to RepBot always follows the following 
      format: 
      
      <pre><code>
	raw <i>cookie</i> <i>command</i> <i>version</i> <i>[parameter]...</i>
      </code></pre>

      Where,
      <ul>
        <li>
	  <code>raw</code> is a prefix common to all client interface protocol
	  commands, to distinguish them from the human-oriented commands. Just
	  like the fibs <code>rawwho</code> command.
	</li>

	<li>
	  <code><i>cookie</i></code> is an arbitrary string passed by 
	  the client interface program. RepBot does not examine the cookie,
	  but simply passes it back in the response. This may simplify
	  programs that issue concurrent requests to RepBot. If a client
	  interface does not require cookies, it should just pass some fixed
	  string here.
        </li>

	<li>
	  <code><i>command</i></code> is the name of the command to be
	  executed by RepBot. The various supported commands are detailed
	  below.
	</li>

	<li>
	  <code><i>version</i></code> is a number describing the version of 
	  the command that the client interface is using. The command versions 
	  are documented in this specification. New implementations should use
	  the latest available version of a command.
	</li>

	<li>
	  <code><i>parameter</i></code> is an argument to the command. 
	  Parameters are described under each command's documentation 
	  separately.
         </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      If a command results in an error, RepBot's response is:
      <pre><code>
        raw <i>cookie</i> error <i>errno</i> <i>message</i>
      </code></pre>

      Where 
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code><i>errno</i></code> is a numeric identifier of the error.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code><i>message</i></code> is a human-readable description of the
          error.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3><code>ask</code> command (version 1)</h3>

    <p>
      The <code>ask</code> command's query format is:
      <pre><code>
        raw <i>cookie</i> ask 1 <i>user</i>...
      </code></pre>
      Where
      <ul>
        <li>
	  <code><i>user</i></code> is the name of a user being queried.
	  More than one user may be specified. Multiple users are separated by
	  space.
	</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The response to an <code>ask</code> query is:
      <pre><code>
        raw <i>cookie</i> ask 1 <i>user reputation vouchers complainers saved-games...</i>
      </code></pre>
      Where
      <ul>
        <li>
	  <code><i>user</i></code> is the name of a user being queried. Users
	  are returned in the same order as they are specified in the query.
	</li>
        <li>
	  <code><i>reputation</i></code> is a signed number indicating the 
	  user's reputation, or the string <code>-</code> indicating that
	  the user does not exist.
	</li>
        <li>
	  <code><i>vouchers</i></code> is the number of users who have vouched
	  for this user, or the string <code>-</code> indicating that
	  the user does not exist.
	</li>
        <li>
	  <code><i>complainers</i></code> is the number of users who have 
	  complained about this user, or the string <code>-</code> indicating 
	  that the user does not exist.
	</li>
        <li>
	  <code><i>saved-games</i></code> is the number of games that the
	  user has, as far as RepBot can determine, or the string 
	  <code>-</code> indicating that the user does not exist.
	</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3><code>list</code> command (version 1)</h3>

    <p>
      The <code>list</code> command's query format is:
      <pre><code>
        raw <i>cookie</i> list 1 <i>user</i>
      </code></pre>
      Where
      <ul>
        <li>
	  <code><i>user</i></code> is the name of a user being queried.
	  Only one user may be specified.
	</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The response to a <code>list</code> query is:
      <pre><code>
        raw <i>cookie</i> list 1 <i>user</i> 
	  reputation <i>reputation</i>
	  vouchers <i>vouchers</i> <i>name</i>...
	  complainers <i>complainers</i> <i>name</i>...
	  vouches <i>vouches</i> <i>name</i>...
	  complaints <i>complaints</i> <i>name</i>...
	  saved <i>saved</i> <i>name</i>...
      </code></pre>
      (all on a single line)

      or, 
      <pre><code>
        raw <i>cookie</i> list 1 <i>user</i> nosuch
      </code></pre>

      Where
      <ul>
        <li>
	  <code><i>user</i></code> is the name of a user being queried.
	</li>
        <li>
	  <code><i>reputation</i></code> is a signed number indicating the 
	  user's reputation.
	</li>
        <li>
	  <code><i>vouchers</i></code> is the number of users who have vouched
	  for this user, followed by their names.
	</li>
        <li>
	  <code><i>complainers</i></code> is the number of users who have 
	  complained about this user, followed by their names.
	</li>
        <li>

	  has vouched, followed by their names.
	</li>
        <li>
	  <code><i>complaints</i></code> is the number of users against whom
	  the user has lodged a complaint, followed by their names.
	</li>
        <li>
	  <code><i>saved</i></code> is the number of users with whom the user
	  has a saved game, as far as RepBot knows, followed by their names.

    <h2>Protocol usage</h2>

    <h3>Initiating queries</h3>

    <p>
      Due to bandwidth concerns, a client interface should initiate a query
      only in response to one of the following events:
      <ul>
        <li>
	  Direct user command, for example clicking the info button while a 
	  user's name is highlighted.
	</li>

	<li>
	  Log-on.
	</li>

	<li>
	  When another user initiates contact with the user (for example, an
	  invitation).
	</li>
      </ul>
      In particular, generating a query on login notifications is likely to
      saturate RepBot's connection.
    </p>  

    <h3>Line length</h3>

    <p>
      The fibs limit on line length appears to b about 1,400 characters. This
      is the only limit on request and response size.
    </p>

    <h3>Concurrency</h3>

    <p>
      RepBot is full concurrent -- it can process multiple queries, from one 
      or more users, simultaneously. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Fibs, however, is not. If you send a command before the preceding command
      has been acknowledged by fibs (<code>** You tell RepBot: ...</code>),
      there is a chance that the first command will be lost. Clients must be
      handle this issue.
    </p>

    <h3>Timeouts</h3>

    <p>
      Client interface programs must be prepared for a query to remain 
      unanswered. It is recommended that each request be timed out 
      (and possibly retried) if RepBot does not respond within 5 seconds.
      (Observed latency is 300-600 ms).
